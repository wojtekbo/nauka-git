      <h1>"Spectrum"</h1>
      <h2>by Florence + The Machine</h2>

      <p>When we first came here We were cold and we were clear With no colors on our skin We were light and paper thin</p>
      <p>And when we first came here We were cold and we were clear With no colors on our skin 'Til we let the spectrum in</p>
      <p>Say my name And every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again</p>
      <p>Say my name As every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again</p>
      <p>Say my name As every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again</p>
      <p>And when we come for you We'll be dressed up all in blue With the ocean in our arms Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms</p>
      <p>And when it's time to pray We'll be dressed up all in grey With metal on our tongues And silver in our lungs</p>
